Today it works well but sessions are stateless — every run starts fresh with no memory of past work.\n\n## The Problem We're Solving\n\nDevelopers using tdd-ai lose context between sessions. There's no way to look back at past workflows, understand patterns in how you work, or measure how your TDD practice is evolving over time.\n\n## The Vision\n\nAdd an optional cloud layer that persists session history and surfaces analytics — while keeping the CLI fully open source and self-hostable.\n\n---\n\n## Product Tiers\n\n### Community Edition (Free, Open Source)\n- Full CLI functionality, unchanged\n- Self-hostable dashboard and backend (Docker Compose)\n- Local session history stored on disk\n- Basic analytics viewable locally\n\n### Managed Cloud (Paid, ~$8–12/month)\n- Everything in Community Edition\n- Hosted dashboard, no infra to manage\n- Automatic backups and updates\n- Session history synced across machines\n- Team/org dashboard (future)\n\nThe managed cloud charges for **convenience**, not features. The self-hosted version will be capable enough for anyone willing to run it themselves.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\nUsers opt in to cloud sync with `tdd-ai login` or a `--sync` flag. At the end of each session, the CLI sends a JSON event to the backend. Nothing changes about the core TDD workflow.\n\n**Data captured per session:**\n- Timestamp and duration\n- Files and modules touched\n- Number of AI iterations\n- Pass/fail outcome\n- Language and framework detected\n\n---\n\n## Dashboard & Analytics\n\nThe web dashboard (open source, self-hostable) shows:\n\n- Session history timeline\n- Which files/modules you TDD most frequently\n- Average iterations to green per session\n- Trends in session length and frequency\n- Heatmap of activity over time\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nKept lean and cheap to run:\n\n- **CLI**: Go (existing)\n- **Backend API**: Cloudflare Workers or Vercel (generous free tier)\n- **Database**: Supabase (free tier covers early growth)\n- **Dashboard**: Next.js or lightweight static HTML\n- **Self-host**: Docker Compose with Postgres + a Node API\n\n---\n\n## Business Model\n\n- CLI stays free and open source forever\n- Managed cloud is the revenue driver\n- Self-hosting is supported and documented — users who self-host were never going to pay, and they become evangelists\n- No AI API costs — the product is pure data persistence and visualization\n\n---\n\n## Principles\n\n- Open first: the community edition is never crippled\n- Self-hosting is possible but the managed version is obviously easier\n- No vendor lock-in: users can export all their data\n- Privacy conscious: users opt in to sync, nothing is sent without consent\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Define the session data schema\n2. Add `tdd-ai login` and `--sync` flag to the CLI\n3. Build the backend API (thin layer over Supabase)\n4. Build a basic dashboard (session list + a few charts)\n5. Package the self-host setup as a Docker Compose file\n6.

Here are my thoughts:\n\n**What works well:**\n\n- **Open core model is the right call.** Keeping the CLI fully open source and charging for convenience (not features) builds trust and adoption. Self-hosters become evangelists — that's exactly right.\n- **Minimal data capture.** The session data you're collecting is lightweight and non-sensitive. Opt-in sync with `tdd-ai login` is the right UX.\n- **The problem is real.** Session history and analytics are a natural extension. You already have structured data (phases, specs, iterations, reflections) — surfacing it over time is genuinely useful.\n- **Lean tech stack.** Supabase free tier + Cloudflare Workers keeps costs near zero until you have paying users.\n\n**Things I'd push back on or refine:**\n\n1. **Start even smaller on the dashboard.** Before building a full Next.js app, consider shipping a `tdd-ai history` CLI command that reads local session history from disk. This validates that people actually want to look back at past sessions before you build a web UI. Ship the analytics loop inside the tool people already use.\n\n2. **$8-12/month might be high for individual devs.** This is competing with \"I could just not have analytics.\" Consider $5/month or a generous free tier (e.g., 30 days of history free, pay for unlimited). The goal is conversion volume, not per-seat revenue early on.\n\n3. **Team/org features should come before you need them for revenue.** Individual developers can self-host easily. Teams are where managed hosting becomes genuinely painful to DIY — that's your real wedge for paid conversion. I'd move team dashboards higher in priority.\n\n4. **\"Language and framework detected\" feels like scope creep.** Your CLI doesn't do this today, and it's not trivial to get right. Cut it from v1 — you already have the valuable data (iterations, pass/fail, duration, files touched) without it.\n\n5. **Define what \"session\" means precisely.** Right now `.tdd-ai.json` is a single mutable file. You'll need to decide: does a \"session\" end when the phase reaches DONE? When the user runs `tdd-ai init` again? When they explicitly close it? This matters for the data model and should be settled before building the schema.\n\n6. **Docker Compose self-host is table stakes but also a support burden.** Document it well and set expectations — \"community supported, not enterprise supported.\" Otherwise you'll spend time debugging people's Docker setups instead of building product.\n\n**What I'd reorder in next steps:**\n\n1. Define what a \"session\" boundary is (start/end events)\n2. Add local session history — save completed sessions to `~/.tdd-ai/history/`\n3. Ship `tdd-ai history` and `tdd-ai stats` CLI commands\n4. Validate that people use them\n5. *Then* build the backend API and dashboard\n6. `tdd-ai login` and sync come after you know the data model is right\n\nThe core insight — that the structured TDD data you're already generating has value over time — is correct. The risk is building the cloud layer before validating that users actually want to review past sessions.
